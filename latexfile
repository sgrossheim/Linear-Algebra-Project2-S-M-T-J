\section{Lighting Games}
    \textbf{Game 1:} A row of five light bulbs is controlled by five switches (Labeled A,B,C,D,E). Each switch changes
    the state (on or off) of the light directly above it and the states of the lights immediately adjacent to the
    left and right. Suppose that initially, all the lights are off. If we want to turn the first, third and fifth lights
    to be on, we can press $B \longrightarrow C \longrightarrow D$ (or $A \longrightarrow C \longrightarrow E$).

                \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
    \textbf{Game 2:} A row of three light bulbs is controlled by three switches (Labeled $A$, $B$, $C$). Each switch changes
    the state of the bulb directly above it and immediately adjacent to the left and right to off $\longrightarrow$ red $\longrightarrow$ green
    $\longrightarrow$ off.

    \textbf{Game 3:} Nine squares, in a $3 \times 3$ array are either red, green, or off. When you push a square, it changes
    its own state and states of some of its neighbors in the following order off $\longrightarrow$ red $\longrightarrow$ green $\longrightarrow$ off. The object
    of the game is to turn all nine squares off. The possible switches are shown below.
